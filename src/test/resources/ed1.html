    <h2 class="t"> Chapter 3112 - Secret </h2>
    <p class="pg">Hearing the stinging dragon's words, Li Qiye smiled and said casually, "Yes, I'm just aggressive, if
        you don't accept it, come and die, I don't mind killing people." </p>
    <p class="pg"> As soon as Li Qiye said this, the air suddenly became heavy and the atmosphere between heaven and
        earth suddenly froze. </p>
    <p class="pg"> At this time, I don't know how many people looked at each other, but there were also many people who
        couldn't help but smile bitterly. </p>
    <p class="pg"> It seemed that no matter when it was, the First Fierce Man was always so direct and simple and
        brutal, as if the First Fierce Man didn't know how to be tactful or wrap up his language organization a bit.
    </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Can't the first fierce person speak a little more tactfully?" There were strong people who also
        murmured, "To put it politely, maybe we all have room to maneuver, there's no need to make everyone so stiff
        that they can't get off the stage." </p>
    <p class="pg"> People, all of them have skin and face, especially the invincible generation, are even better at
        saving face, even willing to fight to the death for the sake of face face. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Now that the first fierce man said such overbearing words in front of the world, it was simply like
        blocking both sides' steps down at once, there was no room for maneuvering between them, so much so that both
        sides were torn apart at once. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Just like just now, whether it was the Eight-foot True Emperor or the Stream Emperor, they all spoke
        with special grace, they all appeared to be particularly polished and wordy, however, the words spoken by the
        First Fierce Man were simple and brutal, and often very easily offended. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "This guy." There were also Patriarchs who could not help but laugh bitterly and said, "Did he come
        from a wilderness background and did not have the congeniality of the Great Church Dao ......" </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Stupid." An ancestor shook his head and said, "Only a fool would think that, it's just that he's
        too lazy to talk. Would you talk politely to an anthill?" ? "But he, he's facing a stinging dragon ah, he's
        facing a golden light master ah." A strong man muttered in disbelief. </p>
    <p class="pg"> This ancestor's gaze was profound as he looked at the First Fierce Man standing there and said
        slowly, "Since his debut, when has the First Fierce Man ever put anyone in his eyes, no matter who they are!"
    </p>
    <p class="pg"> Hearing this, many people were dumbfounded, and when they thought about it, it seemed to be true,
        ever since the First Evil Man had shown his face, he had been so arrogant and overbearing, as if he had never
        taken any of his enemies seriously. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "The long wave pushes forward." At this time, the Stinging Dragon lamented and said, "This old bone
        of ours is getting old, and we don't have the domineering spirit of our youth anymore." </p>
    <p class="pg"> At this point, the Stinging Dragon's voice paused and said slowly, "But, this old bone of mine still
        wants to toss, if Daoist friend insists on making an enemy of us, this old bone of mine, I don't have the
        strength to fight, what's the harm in fighting a battle?" </p>
    <p class="pg"> Although the words of the stinging dragon were very polite, when the words were spoken, they were
        overbearing, and for a moment, it was as if he was seeing the all-powerful stinging dragon from back then again.
    </p>
    <p class="pg"> "A battle, so what's the harm." Li Qiye smiled and said, "I'll follow!" </p>
    <p class="pg"> Having said that, everyone knew that the two sides could no longer avoid a battle, which made all
        the powerful monks watching from afar look at each other. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Only, what everyone did not expect was that the first fierce man had not fought the Golden Light
        Master, but had first fought the Golden Light Master's protector, the Stinging Dragon. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Everyone knew that the Stinging Dragon, as a long-extant Daoist, was not necessarily weaker than the
        Golden Light Master. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "This place is of great significance to us." At this point, the Stinging Dragon said slowly, "In a
        battle with Daoist friends, we will not be confined to any means! If there is anything that offends, then please
        forgive me, Fellow Daoist." </p>
    <p class="pg"> "There's nothing to be offended by." Li Qiye also didn't care, smiling faintly, he said: "Losing is
        just being inferior to others, so if you have any tactics, feel free to use them. Maybe, there won't be this
        opportunity in the future." </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Good, good, good, how domineering." The stinging dragon laughed and said slowly, "How many years
        has it been, how many years has it been since my old bones have heard such words, very good, very good!" </p>
    <p class="pg"> When the Stinging Dragon laughed, the stars in the sky trembled, the sun and the moon flickered, and
        it seemed that all beings trembled with fear under the laughter. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Although the Stinging Dragon was laughing, whoever was there could hear the anger in the Stinging
        Dragon's laughter. </p>
    <p class="pg"> The Stinging Dragon's laughter was so angry that it was understandable to everyone. </p>
    <p class="pg"> At this point, the stinging dragon didn't get angry, that was all already very graceful. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Little sister doesn't think she can do anything." At this time, Xi Huang's voice rang out from the
        carriage, saying, "Wanting to show ugliness for a moment or two, I hope Mr. Li will forgive me." </p>
    <p class="pg"> "What's the harm." Li Qiye laughed and said, "Didn't I also say that? If you guys don't leave, I'll
        sweep this place and bleed for miles. I don't mind no matter how many of you join hands on it." </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Thank you for your understanding, my lord." That afraid that the two sides were about to go at it,
        at this time, the Xie Emperor was still graceful and his words were still polite and courteous. </p>
    <p class="pg"> The Stinging Dragon also did not stop the Stream Emperor when he said those words, and there was no
        doubt that he had acquiesced to the Stream Emperor's action. </p>
    <p class="pg"> At this time, many people drew a breath of cold air, which meant that whether it was the Stinging
        Dragon or the Stream Emperor, Immortal Copper Mountain did not intend to fight Li Qiye alone, and was prepared
        to fight Li Qiye together. </p>
    <p class="pg"> At the Origin level, they tended to prefer to fight alone, and such strong people tended to dislike
        others helping them, not to mention that in a war at this level, people with shallow dao skills going up to help
        would not be of much help at all, and would instead become a burden. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Now the Stinging Dragon was allowing the Stream Emperor to help out, which was indeed a surprise to
        many people. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Although the Stream Emperor was powerful, but, it was only for the strongest people in the world,
        even if she was powerful, she had not yet reached the realm of the Origin Ancestor, and was simply unable to
        reach the heights of the Stinging Dragon. </p>
    <p class="pg"> It could be said that even if the Stream Emperor did her best, she wouldn't be able to help much in
        such a battle, and might even become a burden, but the Stinging Dragon allowed it, was it only because the
        Stinging Dragon needed a helping hand? Thinking about this made many people look at each other, and they all
        felt that it was surprising that Emperor Xi was going to do something. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "From the way you sound, you do have a few points of confidence." Li Qiye smiled and said, "You're
        such a smart woman, I do like you a bit, by all accounts, you won't do anything stupid." </p>
    <p class="pg"> Li Qiye's words were not exactly what everyone thought, after all, it sounded very unwise for
        Emperor Xi to intervene in such a duel. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Duke's wisdom is beyond the reach of my generation." Xi Huang exclaimed and said, "Little sister
        only has one skill in the Shallow Dao, she can't talk about any means." </p>
    <p class="pg"> It was hard to make people hate a woman like Xi Huang, listening to her talk seemed to be just a
        pleasure, just to make people like her, such a woman, indeed only the Golden Light Master's generation could be
        worthy of her. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Back then, my ancestor was trapped in the fierce land and had an enlightenment, and was assisted by
        the proud and proud, creating a path that was different from his original path." Xie Huang spoke slowly and
        said, "Later on my ancestor was not in line with his original dao because of this, so he comprehended but never
        cultivated it. My younger sister is shallow and mistakenly cultivated it ......"? Everyone was surprised when
        they heard this statement from Xi Huang, and everyone was hearing this anecdote for the first time. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Everyone in the world knew that back then, Pride and Rampage had sold the ancestor of the Washing
        Stream, Washing White Ash, to the devil, but, now listening to the Stream Emperor's words like this, it seemed
        like it wasn't so simple back then. </p>
    <p class="pg"> It seems that Proudly Heng sold Washing White Ash to the Devil and then helped Washing White Ash?
        Or, arrogantly selling ash washing to the devil, that's just a bitter trick, that's counting the devil! </p>
    <p class="pg"> No one in this world knew the exact details of the secret matter back then, but the story made it
        clear to future generations that it was far from that simple. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "So much for using me as a litmus test." Li Qiye smiled faintly. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "I don't dare, my little sister just doesn't think she can do it." Emperor Xie was very humble and
        spoke too nicely. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Just as well." Li Qiye didn't care, it didn't matter, and said, "I would like to see what amazing
        creations the arrogant and your first ancestor has, after all, he is a favorite of the heavens, how can the
        geniuses of the world compare to him." </p>
    <p class="pg"> Li Qiye's words like this made many people look at each other again, and everyone could hear as if
        the First Fierce Man appreciated arrogance. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Everyone knew that the First Fierce Man had never put anyone in his eyes, and was simply sightless,
        but now he was so appreciative of arrogance, and it was a completely different era, arrogance had long since
        disappeared into the river of time, but, the First Fierce Man was so appreciative of arrogance, it made people
        feel weird. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Arrogant Heng, isn't that the traitor?" There were also people who muttered, quite dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p class="pg"> This traitorous merchant, Pride and Crossing, had also left a notorious name, although he had
        created such a huge thing as Pride and Crossing Merchant Firm, but, I heard that when he was alive back then,
        many Daoists had been planted in his hands and had suffered a lot of losses at his hands. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Therefore, everyone in the next generation knew that this traitorous merchant, Pride and Proudness,
        was definitely not a good person. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Such a sycophant had been dead for so long, and it was indeed surprising that the first villain in
        sight still appreciated him so much. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Little sister is offended." Just when many people had doubts in their hearts, Emperor Xi said.
    </p>
    <p class="pg"> When Xi Huang's words fell, everyone couldn't help but hold their breath, all of them had their eyes
        wide open, they also wanted to see what kind of ungodly means Xi Huang had. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Everyone knew that the Stream Emperor was very powerful, that even an existence as proud as the
        Golden Transformation War God would not dare to act rashly in front of the Stream Emperor, not only because she
        was the wife of the Golden Light Master, but also because the Stream Emperor herself was very powerful, powerful
        enough to scare a Twelve Palace True Emperor!</p>
