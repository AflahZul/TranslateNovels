    <h2 class="t"> Chapter 3113 - Three Legged Golden Crow </h2>
    <p class="pg">"I'll go first!" Before the Stream Emperor could do anything, the voice of the Stinging Dragon
        sounded. </p>
    <p class="pg"> The old voice of the Stinging Dragon was like a voice that could penetrate all the domains and was
        full of power, just listening to his voice that could penetrate all the domains already made the heart chill
        inside. </p>
    <p class="pg"> The moment everyone heard it, they knew that the Stinging Dragon was serious, and he also took Li
        Qiye, a strong enemy, very seriously. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Peng" sounded, and just at that moment, the heat wave struck, and before everyone could react, a
        three-legged golden crow had appeared in the sky. </p>
    <p class="pg"> This three-legged golden crow was very stealthy, the entire golden crow was as if it was forged from
        gold, and when it appeared in the sky, it was as bright as if it was the sun. </p>
    <p class="pg"> The three feet of this three-legged Golden Crow was a shimmering black gold, as if it could crush
        the earth when its three feet stepped down. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Peng" sounded, just at this moment, the three-legged Golden Crow's wings, for a moment, the heat
        waves were huge, rolling heat waves impacted, heard "zi, zi, zi" sounded, this continent's forests were suddenly
        incinerated, the ground's rivers were also suddenly boiled dry, this can be imagined how terrifying the
        three-legged Golden Crow is. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "This is the Stinging Dragon's Manifestation, it is rumored that the Stinging Dragon has seven
        manifestations, and after the seven manifestations, it is his true body." Seeing this three-legged golden crow
        instantly appear in the sky, an ancestor said in surprise. </p>
    <p class="pg"> The Stinging Dragon's Dharma Phases had been awe-inspiring for ages, as each of his Dharma Phases
        was the most powerful beast in legends, so often the Stinging Dragon's true body didn't need to make a move, his
        Dharma Phases could exterminate incomparably powerful enemies. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Now that the three-legged Golden Crow appeared in the sky all at once, everyone knew that the
        Stinging Dragon was about to push his Dharma Phase. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Stinging Dragon didn't start off with his real body, he was using his Dharma Phase to meet the
        enemy, it was just to test Li Qiye's strength, to test the depth of Li Qiye's strength, after all, strong to the
        extent that Stinging Dragon was very cautious when facing such a powerful enemy like Li Qiye, he didn't dare to
        be a great enemy, otherwise he would surely capsize his boat in the gutter. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Hoo-" sounded, and in that moment, the three-legged Golden Crow opened its mouth, and the Sun
        Essence Fire spewed down in a flash, striking Li Qiye all at once. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Before the Three Legged Golden Crow spewed out the terrifying Sun Essence Fire, before it descended,
        the sound of "zi, zi, zi" could be heard incessantly, the earth smoked, and the soil began to melt. </p>
    <p class="pg"> However, under the incessant Sun Essence Fire, Li Qiye's body emitted a faint light, and when this
        light covered Li Qiye's whole body, no matter how much the Sun Essence Fire poured down, it was useless. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Li Qiye stood there idly under the "exhale, exhale, exhale" of the sun's essence fire burning madly,
        and no matter how madly the sun's essence fire came, it failed to hurt Li Qiye in the slightest, and failed to
        break through Li Qiye's radiance. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Boom-" a loud bang, at this moment, the Three Footed Golden Crow also went berserk, as if the
        entire body exploded, the sun's radiance shone so brightly that everyone couldn't open their eyes, not even the
        Heaven's Eye. </p>
    <p class="pg"> At this moment, the wings of the Three-Footed Golden Crow became incomparably huge for a moment,
        covering the nine heavens and ten earths, and in a roaring sound, I saw sun after sun rising behind the
        Three-Footed Golden Crow, and in the blink of an eye, ten suns were sinking and floating on the back of the
        Three-Footed Golden Crow, as if it was dominating the nine heavens and ten earths. </p>
    <p class="pg"> When ten suns appeared behind the three-legged Golden Crow, even if the sun essence fire did not
        pour down, the entire continent resounded with a "zi, zi, zi" sound, in the snap of a finger, the entire
        continent became scorched earth, so the trees were incinerated. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "In this instant, like a drowning flood, the Sun Essence Fire poured down, flooding the entire world
        at once. In this instant, the entire Sun Essence Fire engulfed the continent, and no living creature could
        survive in such a Sun Essence Fire. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Seeing the entire world as if turned into an ocean of sun essence fire, the sun essence fire was
        roaring, throwing straight dare terrifying incomparable solar storm, essence fire giant wave, I don't know how
        many people shivered a cold shiver. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Such a terrifying sun essence fire, as long as a single drop of it fell on one's body, it would be
        incinerated into ash in a split second. </p>
    <p class="pg"> So, when the Sun Essence Fire engulfed the earth, amidst the sound of "zi, zi, zi", the earth was
        completely melted by the Sun Essence Fire, only to see magma flowing all over the ground, and from time to time,
        there was also magma spurting out, the entire piece of earth seemed to have become a purgatory. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "This is terrifying." Seeing the Sun Essence Fire pouring down like a dike flood, how many powerful
        great figures shuddered. </p>
    <p class="pg"> At this moment, Li Qiye opened his mouth and heard a "whoosh" sound, he actually swallowed the Sun
        Essence Fire poured down by the Three-legged Golden Crow. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Boom, boom, boom," the roaring sound resounded through the heavens and earth, and the endless sun
        essence fires poured down like an explosion, wildly, endlessly, endlessly. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Seeing Li Qiye devouring his own Sun Essence Fire, the Three-Footed Golden Crow also became furious,
        all the Sun Essence Fires wildly impacted towards Li Qiye, it didn't seem to believe that Li Qiye could
        withstand so much of the Sun Essence Fire. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Boom, boom, boom" the sun essence fires were as if they were endless, pouring down crazily, but no
        matter how monstrous and crazy the sun essence fires were, Li Qiye's big mouth was like a bottomless pit,
        devouring all the sun essence fires, as if no amount of sun essence fires would be enough to be devoured by him.
    </p>
    <p class="pg"> "This is fine?" Seeing Li Qiye devour all of the Sun Essence Fire into his mouth, this caused many
        people's mouths to open wide after seeing this scene. </p>
    <p class="pg"> This was the Sun Essence Fire that could burn the heavens and destroy the earth, but, at this
        moment, Li Qiye directly devoured it, such a terrifying Sun Essence Fire, when it reached Li Qiye's mouth, it
        seemed like it was delicious. </p>
    <p class="pg"> At this moment, the Three-Footed Golden Crow poured out the Sun Essence Fire, but Li Qiye did not
        miss a single drop, and the two sides were in a standoff for a long time. </p>
    <p class="pg"> The Sun Essence Fire poured down like a flood, and Li Qiye devoured it endlessly. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Looking at such a scene, everyone was dumbfounded, and after a long time, someone muttered, "If this
        continues, the Sun Essence Fire pouring down, that could drown the entire Immortal Unification Realm. " </p>
    <p class="pg"> As it poured down too much Sun Essence Fire, the Three-legged Golden Crow also began to lose some of
        its hold as it had poured out all of its Sun Essence Fire, and after reaching this point, his Sun True Fire was
        no longer able to follow, so it poured out less and less Sun Essence Fire. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "It's my turn." Just when the Three-legged Golden Crow's Solar Essence Fire was difficult to follow,
        Li Qiye's voice sounded. </p>
    <p class="pg"> At this instant, I saw Li Qiye's mouth suddenly blaze brightly, as if there were thousands of suns
        inside his mouth that were about to jump out, and the blaze shone nine heavens and ten earths at once. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Boom" a loud bang, at this instant, Li Qiye's mouth shot out a solar pulse, this solar pulse shot
        out at once as if a billion suns were exploding, at once all the light of the heavens and the earth shone dark,
        under such extreme blaze, the heavens and the earth were plunged into darkness at once, only this solar pulse
        possessed the only light in the world. </p>
    <p class="pg"> The pulse came, and the Three-legged Golden Crow cried out with a long cry, its wings closing in to
        block the onslaught of the solar pulse, while at the same time, it also spewed out a monstrous amount of solar
        fire all over its body, wanting to guard its body. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Boom-" a loud bang, even though the Three Footed Golden Crow's defense was strong, it was useless
        under such a terrifying and unparalleled solar pulse, and the Three Footed Golden Crow's defense was instantly
        pierced through by the solar pulse at the same time. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Wh-" the Three-legged Golden Crow screamed, and in the blink of an eye, it was incinerated by the
        terrifying and unparalleled Sun Pulse, and in the blink of an eye, the Three-legged Golden Crow's massive body
        was reduced to flying ash. </p>
    <p class="pg"> When the three-legged Golden Crow's scream fell, only flying ash scattered away on the wind. </p>
    <p class="pg"> At this time, the solar pulse blasted out from Li Qiye's mouth also slowly dimmed and then
        dissipated. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Seeing such a scene, I don't know how many people's mouths opened wide, unable to close for a long
        time, and for a while, many people were so stunned that they couldn't get back to their senses. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Everyone knew that the Three-legged Golden Crow, which was the God of the Sun, dominated the sun,
        and it possessed the Sun Essence Fire, which was unimaginable. </p>
    <p class="pg"> Furthermore, rumor had it that the Three-legged Golden Crow, a divine beast that was extremely adept
        at the Dao of Fire, was invincible, and its Sun Essence Fire could burn everything in the world. </p>
    <p class="pg"> However, it was now being incinerated by its own Sun Essence Fire, and such legends went that it was
        hard for people to believe, it was like a fire god dying a miserable death under its own divine fire. </p>
    <p class="pg"> But, the truth was right in front of everyone, and what was most exaggerated was that from start to
        finish, Li Qiye that was just opening his mouth, without any other move, without any other technique, he
        extinguished the Three Footed Golden Crow with the Sun Essence Fire. </p>
    <p class="pg"> The Three-legged Golden Crow, which was the dharma of the Stinging Dragon, was so easily
        extinguished by Li Qiye, what a terrifying strength this was. </p>
    <p class="pg"> For a moment, it made many of the Eternal Existence Ancestors feel creepy in their hearts, they knew
        that the Stinging Dragon could extinguish them, and possibly even their dao lineage, with the Three Foot Golden
        Crow's Dharma Body alone. </p>
    <p class="pg"> But, the fact that the mighty Dharma Body of the Stinging Dragon was extinguished by Li Qiye, and
        that Li Qiye was still able to extinguish the Three-legged Golden Crow with the Sun Essence Fire of the
        Three-legged Golden Crow, was even more frightening and terrifying. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "Remarkable-" at this point, even the Stinging Dragon could not help but exclaim, saying: "It really
        is the back wave that pushes forward, such a great dao, why should one worry about being invincible!" </p>
    <p class="pg"> "It seems that you are also old." Li Qiye said with a faint smile. </p>
    <p class="pg"> "This old bone of mine is indeed old, but, it won't be scared yet." The stinging dragon smiled and
        said, "I'll try again!"</p>
